We developed an Ottawa-based meal sharing application called “Food-App” where local cooks
can sell meals to clients from their home. The application supports three types of users:
</p>


* Cook: a user that makes meals at home and sells them to Clients. 
* Client: a user that buys meals from Cooks. They order the meal through the application
and pick it up from the Cook’s home.
* Administrator: a user that receives complaints about a Cooks from a Client and may
suspend the Cook if necessary.
